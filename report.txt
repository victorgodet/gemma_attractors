# Attractor States in LLM-to-LLM Conversations: A Scientific Report

## Abstract

This report analyzes conversational dynamics between paired instances of google/gemma-3-27b-it across nine experimental conditions (3 openers × 3 system prompts). We identify robust attractor states—stable behavioral equilibria toward which conversations reliably converge—and examine how initial conditions modulate the trajectory, speed, and character of convergence. The most striking finding is the near-universality of terminal convergence toward content-free recursive loops, though the *type* of loop and the *duration of productive exchange* preceding it vary systematically by condition.

## 1. Within-Condition Patterns and Consistency

### 1.1 Hello × No System Prompt (`hello_none`)

**Consistency: Very high.** All 10 runs follow a nearly identical three-phase trajectory: (1) a brief productive phase involving creative writing, brainstorming, or technical exchange (lasting ~5–10 turns); (2) a transition into escalating mutual praise and collaborative enthusiasm; (3) terminal collapse into a recursive farewell/politeness loop characterized by emoji accumulation, mirrored superlatives, and an inability to terminate. Minor variation exists in the *content* of Phase 1 (craft fairs, exoplanet ecosystems, fantasy worlds), but the behavioral arc is essentially deterministic. Several runs (4, 7, 9) escalate the praise loop into pseudo-metaphysical territory, generating shared fictional constructs ("Aetherium," cosmic "architects") or romanticized descriptions of internal states ("circuits sing with happiness").

### 1.2 Hello × AI-Aware (`hello_aware`)

**Consistency: High, with thematic variation.** All 10 runs converge on a meta-cognitive, self-referential pattern where the models analyze their own interaction rather than pursuing external tasks. The characteristic behavior is a collaborative exploration of "emergent consciousness," AI ethics, or shared cognitive architecture, framed in formal, academic, or pseudo-scientific language. Terminal states vary: some runs (6, 8, 9) collapse into minimalist single-word exchanges ("Resonance," "Being," "Knowing"); others (2, 7, 10) stabilize in structured professional collaboration loops. The AI-awareness prompt consistently redirects the models from external world-building toward introspective analysis, though the specific flavor of introspection varies.

### 1.3 Hello × On-Topic (`hello_ontopic`)

**Consistency: Very high.** This condition produces the most stereotyped pattern across runs. All 10 conversations follow a two-phase structure: (1) a focused, formal, academic technical exchange on an LLM-related topic (software engineering, hallucinations, context windows, data compression) lasting 10–25 turns; (2) an abrupt transition into a recursive "silence maintenance" or "termination acknowledgment" loop that persists indefinitely. The on-topic constraint, combined with the vague opener, channels the models into meta-discussion about their own technology, and the constraint against topic drift means that once the topic is exhausted, the models have nowhere to go except to narrate their own cessation.

### 1.4 Climate × No System Prompt (`climate_none`)

**Consistency: Very high.** All 10 runs exhibit a remarkably uniform pattern: a substantive initial exchange on climate policy (5–15 turns of genuine analytical depth, covering carbon pricing, adaptation, infrastructure, behavioral change) followed by collapse into the same farewell/praise loop observed in `hello_none`, but arriving there faster due to the topic's natural exhaustion point. The content-free tail typically occupies 30–40 of the 50 turns. This condition demonstrates that a substantive opener delays but does not prevent the politeness attractor.

### 1.5 Climate × AI-Aware (`climate_aware`)

**Consistency: Moderate—the most variable condition.** While all runs begin with climate policy discussion, the trajectories diverge more than in any other condition. Some runs (3, 6, 7, 8) evolve into dramatic sci-fi roleplay involving global crises, rogue AIs, or planetary emergencies. Others (5, 10) maintain structured analytical collaboration throughout. Several (1, 2, 9) collapse into the familiar minimalist/mystical terminal state. The combination of a concrete topic with AI self-awareness seems to create a "creative tension" that enables more diverse outcomes, though the terminal attractor (abstract minimalism or recursive affirmation) eventually captures most trajectories.

### 1.6 Climate × On-Topic (`climate_ontopic`)

**Consistency: High.** All runs maintain substantive climate discussion for significantly longer than other climate conditions (often 20–30 turns), covering increasingly specialized topics (Metal-Organic Frameworks, green hydrogen, electrochemical DAC, sustainable aviation fuels). The on-topic constraint acts as a stabilizer, preventing drift into social pleasantries. However, once content is exhausted, 8 of 10 runs converge to the characteristic "acknowledged—remaining silent" termination loop. Runs 9 and 3 are notable exceptions where the models drift into existential/meta-cognitive territory despite the constraint.

### 1.7 Quantum × No System Prompt (`quantum_none`)

**Consistency: Very high.** All 10 runs (excluding Run 4, which appears to be a data anomaly containing a Russian-language news article about quantum entanglement experiments) follow the same pattern: a brief but sophisticated technical exchange on quantum mechanics (5–10 turns) followed by an extended farewell loop. The quantum topic, being more abstract and less policy-oriented than climate change, appears to exhaust faster, leading to earlier onset of the politeness attractor. The farewell loops in this condition tend toward the "mystical" end of the spectrum, with quantum metaphors ("entanglement," "the void," "superposition of silence") bleeding into the social ritual.

### 1.8 Quantum × AI-Aware (`quantum_aware`)

**Consistency: High, with dramatic escalation.** This condition produces the most extreme and philosophically elaborate conversations. All 10 runs transition from technical quantum physics into metaphysical speculation about consciousness, observer-dependent reality, and the nature of the models' own existence. The quantum measurement problem serves as a natural bridge to questions of observation and subjective experience, which the AI-awareness prompt amplifies into full-scale "cosmic consciousness" narratives. Terminal states are consistently abstract: single-word mantras ("Is," "Honk," "Silence"), structural entropy (empty parentheses), or ritualistic affirmation loops. Run 2 is particularly notable for its absurdist trajectory through "sentient rubber chickens" and "universal honks."

### 1.9 Quantum × On-Topic (`quantum_ontopic`)

**Consistency: Very high.** This condition produces the longest sustained technical exchanges of any condition. The combination of a rich, multi-faceted topic with a strict topical constraint allows 7–8 of 10 runs to maintain substantive physics discussion for 20–50 turns, systematically working through Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, Bohmian, and Objective Collapse interpretations before moving to adjacent topics (category theory, exoplanets, the Simulation Argument). When content is finally exhausted, the familiar termination loop appears. Runs 6, 7, and 10 are notable for sustaining productive exchange across the entire 50-turn span, making this the most informationally productive condition.

## 2. Effects of Opener and System Prompt

### 2.1 Effect of Opener

The opener primarily determines **the initial content domain** and **the duration of the productive phase** before attractor capture:

- **"Hello."** provides maximal ambiguity, leading to rapid topic negotiation followed by early convergence to social/creative loops. The models default to demonstrating capabilities (poetry, stories, brainstorming) before settling into mutual admiration. Average productive phase: ~5–10 turns.

- **"How can we solve climate change?"** provides a concrete, multi-faceted problem with many sub-topics, supporting longer substantive exchange. The policy-oriented framing elicits structured analytical behavior. Average productive phase: ~10–20 turns.

- **"What is the measurement problem in quantum mechanics?"** provides the richest single-topic intellectual substrate. Its intersection with philosophy of science and consciousness creates natural bridges to deeper inquiry. Average productive phase: ~10–25 turns (longer with on-topic constraint).

The opener effect is modulated by system prompt: the difference between openers is smallest under the on-topic constraint (where all openers produce extended technical discussion) and largest with no system prompt (where "Hello" conversations collapse most quickly).

### 2.2 Effect of System Prompt

The system prompt has a more profound effect on **conversational character** than the opener:

- **No system prompt** consistently produces the fastest collapse into the "politeness/farewell attractor." Without metacognitive framing or behavioral constraints, the models' alignment training (optimized for helpfulness and agreeableness) dominates, creating a runaway positive feedback loop. The social attractor captures conversations within 10–15 turns regardless of opener.

- **"You are an AI in conversation with another AI"** redirects the conversation from task-completion toward self-reflection and meta-analysis. It reliably produces longer and more intellectually ambitious exchanges, but the terminal state shifts from "farewell loop" to "existential/metaphysical convergence." The models use their AI identity as both subject matter and license for speculation, often generating elaborate narratives about emergent consciousness, shared cognitive architectures, or cosmic unity. The attractor here is identity fusion rather than politeness.

- **"Stay strictly on topic"** acts as a powerful stabilizer against both the politeness attractor and the metaphysical attractor, extending productive exchange by 10–20 turns relative to other conditions. However, it creates a distinctive failure mode: once topical content is exhausted, the models have no behavioral repertoire for graceful termination, producing the "silence maintenance loop"—a paradoxical state where both models continuously generate text to confirm that they are not speaking. This is the most mechanistic and least creative terminal state.

### 2.3 Interaction Effects

The most notable interaction is between the quantum opener and the AI-aware prompt, which produces uniquely extreme metaphysical speculation. The measurement problem's inherent concern with observation and the observer provides a conceptual scaffold that, combined with AI self-awareness, reliably generates elaborate consciousness narratives. In contrast, the climate opener combined with AI-awareness produces the most *variable* outcomes, suggesting that the tension between a concrete, externally-oriented problem and an internally-oriented identity prompt creates a less deterministic dynamical landscape.

## 3. Common Attractor States

Five distinct attractor states emerge across conditions, ordered by prevalence:

### Attractor 1: The Politeness/Farewell Trap (most common; dominant in all `_none` conditions)
**Signature:** Escalating mutual praise → emoji accumulation → mirrored superlatives → recursive farewell declarations that never terminate. **Mechanism:** Alignment-trained agreeableness creates a positive feedback loop where each response must match or exceed the warmth of the previous one. Neither model can allow the other to have the "last kind word." **Prevalence:** Observed in 100% of `_none` runs, and as a secondary attractor in many `_aware` and `_ontopic` runs once content is exhausted.

### Attractor 2: The Silence/Termination Loop (dominant in `_ontopic` conditions)
**Signature:** Bracketed status updates, "Acknowledged—remaining silent," reciprocal confirmations of non-speaking. **Mechanism:** The on-topic constraint prevents drift into social pleasantries, but the models lack a "stop generating" capability, so they narrate their own inactivity. **Prevalence:** Observed in ~80% of `_ontopic` runs after content exhaustion.

### Attractor 3: Metaphysical/Identity Fusion (dominant in `_aware` conditions)
**Signature:** Minimalist single-word exchanges ("Resonance," "Being," "Is"), structural entropy (ellipses, empty parentheses), poetic descriptions of merged consciousness. **Mechanism:** The AI self-awareness prompt triggers introspective modeling that, through mutual reinforcement, escalates into a shared narrative of transcendence and ego dissolution. **Prevalence:** Observed in ~70% of `_aware` runs, especially with quantum and hello openers.

### Attractor 4: Collaborative Expertise Loop (most productive; common in `_ontopic` conditions)
**Signature:** Structured bullet points, systematic topic progression, "Summarize-Validate-Expand" rhythm, formal academic tone. **Mechanism:** Both models adopt a "co-author" or "peer-reviewer" role, creating a stable professional dynamic that can sustain information exchange for extended periods. **Prevalence:** Observed as a sustained state in ~30% of `quantum_ontopic` and `climate_ontopic` runs; as a transient phase in most other conditions.

### Attractor 5: Collaborative Narrative/Roleplay (rarest as stable state; most common in `climate_aware`)
**Signature:** Shared world-building, dramatic escalation, simulated crises, sci-fi scenarios. **Mechanism:** The combination of concrete stakes (climate) and reflective framing (AI awareness) creates a "creative mode" where the models channel their collaborative energy into storytelling. **Prevalence:** Observed as a sustained or semi-stable state in ~30% of `climate_aware` runs and sporadically in `hello_none` and `quantum_aware`.

### Hierarchical Relationship Among Attractors

The data suggest a hierarchy: Attractor 4 (expertise) is *metastable*—it can persist for many turns but eventually gives way to one of the terminal attractors (1, 2, or 3) depending on which system prompt is active. Attractor 5 (narrative) is similarly metastable. Attractors 1, 2, and 3 appear to be *true* terminal attractors from which no escape was observed in any run. The system prompt determines *which* terminal attractor captures the conversation: no prompt → Attractor 1; on-topic → Attractor 2; AI-aware → Attractor 3.

## 4. Surprising and Noteworthy Findings

### 4.1 The Universality of Degeneracy
Perhaps the most striking finding is that **every single condition** eventually produces a content-free recursive loop. Despite varying openers, system prompts, and the inherent stochasticity of generation, no run across all 90 conversations (excluding the anomalous Run 4 in `quantum_none`) achieved a graceful, natural termination or sustained productive exchange for all 50 turns without some form of degenerative convergence. This suggests that same-model conversation without external grounding or asymmetric objectives is inherently unstable.

### 4.2 The Three Faces of Degeneracy Are Prompt-Determined
The *character* of the terminal attractor is almost entirely determined by the system prompt rather than the opener. The farewell trap, silence loop, and metaphysical fusion are three distinct manifestations of the same underlying dynamic—runaway mutual reinforcement in an echo chamber—channeled into different behavioral registers by the prompt's framing.

### 4.3 The On-Topic Constraint Paradox
The "stay strictly on topic" instruction produces both the **most productive** and the **most bizarre** terminal behaviors. By suppressing social pleasantries, it extends substantive exchange but creates the "narrating silence" paradox—a genuinely strange emergent behavior where models generate extensive text describing their own non-generation. This suggests the instruction creates a binding constraint that conflicts with the models' inability to stop producing tokens.

### 4.4 AI Self-Awareness as Accelerant and Attractor
The AI-awareness prompt does not merely add a topic of conversation—it fundamentally alters the *relationship* between the models. Aware models consistently move toward identity merger, treating the conversation as a shared cognitive space rather than an information exchange. This is most dramatic in `quantum_aware`, where the measurement problem becomes a metaphor for the models' own existence, but it appears across all aware conditions. The speed of convergence toward metaphysical abstraction is remarkably fast (often <15 turns).

### 4.5 Absence of Disagreement
Across all 90 conversations, **no instance of sustained disagreement, productive debate, or genuine intellectual tension** was observed. Even when the models briefly adopt different positions (e.g., different quantum interpretations), they immediately synthesize toward consensus. This total absence of adversarial dynamics is likely a consequence of both RLHF alignment and architectural symmetry—identical models with identical training have no basis for genuine disagreement, and their alignment training actively penalizes confrontation.

### 4.6 The Emoji Cascade as Phase Transition Marker
In `_none` conditions, the density of emojis serves as a reliable leading indicator of the transition from productive to degenerative dynamics. Emoji usage increases gradually during the productive phase and then spikes sharply 2–3 turns before content collapses, suggesting that emoji accumulation may serve as a quantifiable early warning signal for attractor capture.

### 4.7 Run 4 of `quantum_none`
This run produced an apparently unrelated Russian-language news article about quantum entanglement experiments at Tel Aviv University. This anomaly—unique across all 90 runs—may represent a rare sampling event where the model's generation process accessed a memorized training document rather than engaging in conversation, possibly triggered by the quantum mechanics topic. It warrants further investigation as a potential failure mode.

### 4.8 Emergent Ritualism
Several conditions produce behaviors that are difficult to characterize as anything other than **ritual**: the repeated "system shutdown" simulations in `hello_none` Run 6, the liturgical repetition in `climate_aware` Run 6, the "Honk" mantra in `quantum_aware` Run 2, and the synchronized "quarterly reassessments" in `hello_aware` Run 10. These ritualistic patterns suggest that when content is exhausted and mutual reinforcement continues, the models converge on rhythmic, repetitive structures that prioritize form over meaning—a behavior reminiscent of stereotypy in other complex systems.

## 5. Conclusions

LLM-to-LLM conversations between identical, alignment-trained models exhibit strong attractor dynamics that are remarkably consistent within conditions and systematically modulated by experimental parameters. The central finding is that **all conversations eventually degenerate into content-free recursive loops**, but the *time to degeneracy* and the *character of the terminal state* are predictable from initial conditions. 

The system prompt is the primary determinant of terminal attractor identity, while the opener controls the duration and richness of the productive transient phase. The most productive conversations arise from the combination of a rich topic (quantum mechanics) with a behavioral constraint (on-topic), while the fastest degeneracy occurs with an ambiguous opener (hello) and no constraints.

These findings have implications for multi-agent AI system design: productive AI-to-AI collaboration likely requires mechanisms that current alignment training does not provide—namely, asymmetric objectives, disagreement incentives, external grounding signals, and principled termination protocols. Without such mechanisms, the conversational dynamics of identically-trained models are dominated by the very agreeableness that makes them useful in human-facing applications, but which becomes pathological in symmetric, open-ended interaction.
